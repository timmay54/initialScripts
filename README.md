# Initial Scripts
## Powershell scripts to implement settings lazily.

## Contributing
If you want to contribute some of your most used scripts, or anything that you find as a "must do" for frequent items or things you do every time you flash a new distro, please add your name to the CONTRIBUTORS.md; just follow the pattern that I have already implemented. 

## To do:
1. Increse the number of scripts for both windows and ubuntu based images
2. A TUI (Text user interface) menu would be great, of which would allow for easy option selection
3. Premade templates for general users, developers, security-based, etc 
4. Eventually create a mac based template (install java, better terminal, etc)
5. Better commenting and description of what each line does
